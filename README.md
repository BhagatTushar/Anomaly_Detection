# Anomaly_Detection
This Anomaly Detection project which i have done during my tenure at the Infosys Springboard Internship.

## Milestone 1 : EDA & Pre-processing 
- In this milestone  have some basic pre-processing of dataset like handling missing values and replacing it with different techniques.
- Done some visualizations to get better insights of data like univariate and bivariate analysis.

## Milestone 2 : Clustering and analysis
- Used K-means and DBSCAN clustering to analyze the different distinct groups/cluster between data.
- used different techniques to get optimum no of clusters like Elbow Plot , Variance calculation and others.

## Milestone 3 : Machine Learning Models
- Done some Festure Engineering Part before applying ML models.
- Encoded the categorical column with low unique value (having only 2 distinct value) with Binary encoding and columns with high cardinal values with frequency encoding to overcome from problem of Sparse data which can be occured by using other techniques.
- Used Standard Scalar to Scale all The values.
-  **Machine Learning Models**
    - 1 . Isolation Forest
    - 2 . Elliptic Envelope
    - 3 . One-Class SVM
- Done viualization for each Machine Learning Model like ScatterPlots for numerical columns to visualize anomalies and normal points for categorical columns used Barplots and Piecharts

## Milestone 4 : Deep Learning Autoencoders
- used simple feed-forward neural network for detecting anomalies
- consisting 5 layers
- used reconstruction error as metric to differentiate between _Normal_ and _anomalous_ entries based on threshold.
- Done viualization for Deep Learning Learning Model like ScatterPlots for numerical columns to visualize anomalies and normal points for categorical columns used Barplots and Piecharts
