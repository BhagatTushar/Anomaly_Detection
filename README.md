# Anomaly_Detection
This Anomaly Detection project which i have done during my tenure at the Infosys Springboard Internship.

# Milestone 1 : EDA & Pre-processing 
- In this milestone  have some basic pre-processing of dataset like handling missing values and replacing it with different techniques.
- Done some visualizations to get better insights of data like univariate and bivariate analysis.

# Milestone 2 : Clustering and analysis
- Used K-means and DBSCAN clustering to analyze the different distinct groups/cluster between data.
- used different techniques to get optimum no of clusters like Elbow Plot , Variance calculation and others.

# Milestone 3 : Machine Learning Models
- Done some Festure Engineering Part before applying ML models.
- Encoded the categorical column with low unique value (having only 2 distinct value) with Binary encoding and columns with high cardinal values with frequency encoding.
